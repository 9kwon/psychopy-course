# Initiate keyboard
from psychopy import iohub
io = iohub.launchHubServer()
keyboard = io.devices.keyboard

# WAITING FOR KEYBOARD
print 'Listening now...'
keyboard.waitForKeys(chars=['@', '!'])
print 'key event!'

"""
EXERCISE:
    * Make a small script that waits until the subject has 
      written 'Dawg!' 
      Hint: (D, a, w, g, !).
      
    * Now start a psychopy Window with a TextStim that updates to show
      this in text, as if one was typing in a text field.
      (Maybe the text should turn green upon success?)
      
    * Pro: use keyboard.state to determine if the subject is currently
      holding down a, s, d, f, and g. 
      Hint: dict.keys() and set(lista) == set(listb)

# Identical to doing this (although there is no hog duration here):
io.wait(1)
io.clearEvents('all')
print 'listening now!'

        print event

# GETTING KEYBOARD DURING RUNTIME
