PSYCHOPY EXPERIMENT SCRIPT TEMPLATE
The script is a part of a PsychoPy course which you can learn more about here:
http://lindeloev.net/?page_id=134

It does require that you have the ppc.py in the same folder as the script.
Find ppc.py on the course website.

PURPOSE OF THIS SCRIPT:
This is a template for scripting psychopy experiments while following good
practicies. The template is thoroughly commented in order to explain the code
as well as the rationale of doing it this particular way. The actual code
length without comments and initial variables is just around 80 lines, so it's
not as overwhelming as it might look :-) This script is targeted at psychopy
beginners with a few general purposes: (1) it introduces the basic psychopy
functions you're most likely to need in a full experiment, (2) proposes an
effecient and flexible code structure which you can use as a head-start when
coding most experiments, (3) prevent rookie mistakes in timing and crashes.


THE EXPERIMENT:
This is a silly experiment in which users are asked to indicate the orientation
of a gabor patch. It can show up at different locations and is either preceeded
by a fixation cross indicating it's true position or a false position.
Furthermore, it has various durations. Maybe we wan't to see the impact of cue
and stimulus duration on identification performance.

Formally the design is factorial:
    orientation x duration x repetitions x positions x trueCue


FEATURES OF THE SCRIPT:
The important thing is that this experiment incorporates most features that
experiments will use:
    * Initial dialogue box
    * Display messages and ask questions to participants (intro, instructions,
      per-trial-questions etc.). Records reaction time. Also pauses at
      regular intervals of trials.
    * Nice control of blocks and conditions. Easy to run conditions in multiple
      orders to counterbalance possible order effects.
    * Accurate timing of stimulus presentation (by monitor frames instead of
      milliseconds) and assessment of this timing. Read why this is important
      here: http://www.psychopy.org/general/timing/millisecondPrecision.html
      Also accurate timing of keyboard responses.
    * Use eye-degrees as units of visual size.
    * Save data after each trial to minimize data loss in the event of a crash.
    * Easily scalable to complex experiments.

CODE STRATEGY / PHILOSOPHY
The general coding strategy is to prepare absolutely everything before the
critical data-collection part begins. The purpose is to minimize computational
load and complexity during the actual presentation of the stimuli. As such,
lag and potential errors is minimized prevented during stimulus presentation.
Most of the stuff is done before the welcome screen even hits the participant.
Only a little is left to be done before each trial (change relevant
stimulus parameters for this trial) and this is done before the timing critical
part.

Another general coding strategy is to keep stuff-you-or-others-might-change-often
in dedicated sections. This is the VARIABLES and the RUN EXPERIMENT sections.
This is the stuff that you would usually report in your method's section
(like the ISI, number of trials, question text, sequence of blocks etc.).
The philosophy is to keep function and "content" separate so that you (and
others) may easily adapt the experiment without having to scroll down through
the code to change these variables in a lot of obscure places.


CODE STRUCTURE:
The overall code structure of this template goes like this:
    * VARIABLES: variables pertaining to trials and stimulus presentation.
    * IMPORT the python modules to be used. The python convention is to import in
      the beginning of the script.
    * DIALOGUE AND STIMULI: Initiate psychopy stimuli and handy variables. This is
      computationally heavy.
    * FUNCTIONS: Define functions that does all the stimulus presentation.
    * RUN EXPERIMENT: actually execute the experiment, with the instructions and
      blocks in any order you'd like.

    """
    Return a list of trials (list of dictionaries) in advance of actually displaying them.

    trialList = [
         {'xpos': 0, 'ori': 90, 'durationReal': '', 'response': '', 'condition': 'falseFix', 'subject': u'nick', 'rt': '', 'no': 0, 'gender': u'male', 'age': u'42', 'score': '', 'fixPos': -3},

         {'xpos': -3, 'ori': 0, 'durationReal': '', 'response': '', 'condition': 'falseFix', 'subject': u'nick', 'rt': '', 'no': 2, 'gender': u'male', 'age': u'42', 'score': '', 'fixPos': 3},

    ]

    Calling trials[0] gives the first trial, trials[1] the 2nd trial etc.
    When the experiment executes, it will simply loop over these trials from first to last using

    for trial in trialList:
        # do something with the trial here

    It is suggested to keep all non-constant information in trials instead of
    external variables, "non-constant" being what is not the same for all trials
    and all subjects. This is stuff that you want to do statistics on.
    Remember, the problem is never too much data - it's too little data.

    Note that every trial-dictionary should have the same fields. Note also
    that there are placeholders for answers to be collected (e.g. ans and ansTime).

    You could use psychopy.data.TrialHandler instead of the code below, which
    would be great for this simple case. But building your trials like below
    is scaleable to more complex cases and you remain in control.
