PSYCHOPY EXPERIMENT SCRIPT TEMPLATE, VERSION 2012-10
Free to use for any purpose. Credit is nice but not required.
By Jonas Lindel√∏v: jonas@cnru.dk

----------

This is a template for scripting psychopy experiments while following good
practicies. The template is thoroughly commented in order to explain the code
as well as the rationale of doing it this particular way. The actual code
length without comments and initial variables is just around 75 lines, so it's
not as overwhelming as it might look :-) This script is targeted at psychopy
beginners with a few general purposes: (1) it introduces the basic psychopy
functions you're most likely to need in a full experiment, (2) proposes an
effecient and flexible code structure which you can use as a head-start when
coding most experiments, (3) prevent rookie mistakes in timing and crashes.

This is a silly experiment in which users are asked to indicate the position
of a briefly presented white circle. The important thing is that this
experiment incorporates most features that experiments will use:
- Initial dialogue box
- Display messages and ask questions to participants (intro, instructions,
    per-trial-questions etc.). Records reaction time. Also pauses at
    regular intervals of trials.
- Nice control of blocks and conditions. Easy to run conditions in multiple
    orders to counterbalance possible order effects.
- Accurate timing of stimulus presentation (by monitor frames instead of
     milliseconds) and assessment of this timing. Read why this is important
     here: http://www.psychopy.org/general/timing/millisecondPrecision.html
- Use eye-degrees as units of visual size.
- Save data after each trial to minimize data loss in the event of a crash.
- Easily scalable to complex experiments

The general coding strategy is to prepare absolutely everything before the
critiacal data-collection part begins. The purpose is to minimize computational
load and complexity during the actual presentation of the stimuli. As such,
lag and potential errors is minimized prevented during stimulus presentation.
Most of the stuff is done before the welcome screen even hits the participant
(initiate stimuli). Some is done before each block (prepare each trial in
advance). Only a little is left to be done before each trial (change relevant
stimulus parameters for this trial).

Another general coding strategy is to keep stuff-you-or-others-might-change-often
in dedicated sections. This is the VARIABLES and the RUN EXPERIMENT sections.
This is the stuff that you would usually report in your method's section
(like the ISI, number of trials, question text, sequence of blocks etc.).
The philosophy is to keep function and "content" separate so that you (and
others) can easily adapt the experiment without having to scroll down through
the code to change these variables in a lot of obscure places.

The overall code structure of this template goes like this:
- IMPORT the python modules to be used. The python convention is to import in
     the beginning of the script.
- VARIABLES: variables pertaining to trials and stimulus presentation.
- DIALOGUE AND STIMULI: Initiate psychopy stimuli and handy variables. This is
     computationally heavy.
- FUNCTIONS: Define functions that does all the stimulus presentation.
- RUN EXPERIMENT: actually execute the experiment, with the instructions and
     blocks in any order you'd like.

Note that questions, response options and response keys are combined in
python dictionaries ({'key':value}). Keeping this in standard structures
simplifies stuff by avoiding the introduction of too many variables and
makes it easy to write a single simple function to display all questions,
thus avoiding code duplication.

    A makeTrials('noBlank') with repTrialFactor=2 could generate a trial list like this::

    Calling trials[0] gives the first trial, trials[1] the 2nd trial etc.
    When the experiment executes, it will simply loop over these trials from first to last

    I suggest that you keep all presentation information in trials instead of
    external variables. In that way you know exactly how each trial was presented.
    The problem is never too much data - it's too little data.

    Note that every trial-dictionary should have the same fields. Note also
    that there are placeholders for answers to be collected (e.g. ans and ansTime). We
    defined these fields in the beginning in saveCategories which was later converted
    to dataDict.

    You could use psychopy.data.TrialHandler instead of the code below, which
    would be great for this simple case. But building your trials like below
    is scaleable to more complex cases.
