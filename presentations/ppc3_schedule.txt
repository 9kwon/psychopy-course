SCHEDULE FOR DAY 3
------------------

makeTrialList:
	1. Start with an empty trial with full structure
	2. Make oris = [0, 90] and create those trials
	3. Exercise: make trials by adding for-loops.
	4. Randomize, add trial['no'] and put in function

Set up stimuli and variables.
	1. Window (copy-paste)
	2. Exercise: various stimuli and variables
	
Present a trial:
	1. Make function, call makeTrialList and loop through trials.
	2. Make the fixation cross
	3. Exercise: add other flip-loops and render using trial.
	4. Collect responses
	5. Exercise: score the trial
	6. Save trial using ppc.writer. Inspect output

Finishing up:
	1. Make dialogue with "subjectID" and "mood = ['happy', 'sad', 'meh']
	2. Exercise: finish dialogue
	3. React to condition in makeTrialList and execution
	4. Add breaks
	5. Assess timing of stimuli

	
EXERCISES:
------------------
"""
Exercise 1: create trialList.
    * add for-loops so that every combination of the above variables is generated.
      oris --> trial['ori'],
      positions --> trial['xpos'],
      framesStim --> trial['duration']
    * add a for-loop so that each trial is repeated "repetitions" times
      hint: range(repetitions) is a list with the length "repetitions"
    * for now, we're just going to deal with the "trueFix" condition.
      set trial['fixPos'] to the the same as trial['xpos'].

    * pros: randomize the trialList after it is generated.
      hint: random.sample() or random.shuffle()
    * pros: pack this in a method called "makeTrialList(condition)" which
      returns the trialList
"""

"""
Exercise 2: create stimuli.
Now we're going to add stimuli to the "import and stimuli" section and add
control of various stimuli-properties from the "variables" section. Suggested
variable names are ("quoted in parenthesis").

    * Create a window ("win") using degrees as units.
      Let the user specify distance to the monitor ("monDistance"), width of
      the monitor ("monWidth") and resolution of the monitor ("monSizePix").
      Hint: use monitors module and of course visual.Window.

      Furthermore, the window should be fullscreen, have a black background and
      allowGUI = False.

    * Make a gabor patch ("stimGabor"). Let the user specify SF ("stimSF"),
      opacity ("stimOpacity") and size ("stimSize").
      hint: visual.GratingStim, mask='gauss'.

    * Make a fixation cross ("stimFix"). Let the user specify the height ("fixHeight").
      Hint: visual.TextStim with the text '+'.

    * Make a text for a break ("stimText"). Let the user specify position ("messagePos")
      and height ("messageHeight"). Set the wrapWidth=999 to avoid uncontrolled line breaks.

    * make a two beeps ("beepSuccess") and ("beepFail") using sound.SoundPyo.
      Suggestions for success: a C of 0.1 seconds at octave 6
      Suggestions for fail: a C of 0.4 seconds at octave 4

    * Make a clock ("clock"). We're going to use it to assess timing of responses and stimuli.
      hint: core.Clock

    * pros: start working on a method ("runBlock") in the "methods" section which
          1. generates a trialList using makeTrialList
          2. loops through trials
          3. present a fixation cross in a flip-loop
          4. present a stimulus in a flip-loop
          5. present a mask in a flip-loop
          6. collect response (event.waitKeys will do here)
"""

"""
Exercise 3: present stimuli in flip-loops.
    * Present the stimulus for the correct duration with the fixation cross on top.
      Remember to set the orientation and position of the gabor patch
      in the beginning of the trial.
      Hint: all the stuff you need is available in trial['duration'], trial['ori'] etc.
      Hint: flip-loop over trial['duration']
      Hint: stimGabor.setOri and setPos

    * Present the mask for the correct duration.
      Hint: we need a new variable "framesMask" to control mask duration.
      Hint: draw first at horizontal then a vertical gabor patch and then flip.

    * Then show a fixation cross again, for the data collection. No duration is
      needed as we're going to use event.waitKeys.

    * Pro: if your concerned about the timing of drawing the mask, you can make
      a visual.BufferImageStim() "screenshot" in the "stimuli" section and use that.
"""

"""
Exercise 4: handle responses and give feedback:
    * save trial['score']. Should be 1 on correct response and 0 otherwise.
      Hint: trial['ori'] and trial['response'] should match - sort of.
      Hint: think in everyday language: "if the orientation was 90 and the subject
      pressed left, trial['score'] should be 1." etc.
    * Play the beepSuccess if subject answered correctly, and the beepFail otherwise.
      Hint: beepSuccess.play()

    * Pros: if you want to record responses already from e.g. stimulus onset,
      use ppc.Keyboard because we're in flip-loops and event.getKeys/event.waitKeys
      would fail to deliver exact timing here.
      Hint: the .reset() method clears all earlier events and resets timing.
"""

"""
Exercise 5: create initial dialogue.
    * Change it so that we now have:
        SubjectID, 
		condition: "trueFix" or "falseFix"
        age
        gender: "male" or "female"

    * Change the order to the following: subject, age, gender, condition.
"""

"""
Exercise 6: update trials using info from the dialogue.
    Update the trialList so that subject, age and gender takes their values
    from the dialogue box. We're going to keep condition being determined by
    the argument to makeTrialList.
"""

"""
Exercise 7 (for the over-achievers): test and modify your experiment.
	* I'm worried that the drawing of the mask is too slow. Test it.
	  Hint: ppc.timer using a multi-line script.
	* What is the actual visual angle extended by the gabor patch?
	  Adjust so that it is closer to 5 degrees.
	  Hint: ppc.deg2cm
	* Add a new position to the task.
